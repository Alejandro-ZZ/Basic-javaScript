# Basic-javaScript

This repository is based on the [Using JavaScript, JQuery, and JSON in Django](https://www.coursera.org/learn/django-javascript-jquery-json) course and
there are two examples in it: 

- JavaScript
- JQuery

In those examples basic codes, that can be run in the browser, are shown; some of them are implemented in one of the Django's app named "ads", developed 
in the other courses of the [Django for Everybody](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/django) specialization. The complete [ads](https://alejandrozz.pythonanywhere.com/ads/) app is host by [pythonanywhere](https://www.pythonanywhere.com/). 

## Note: 

Because the app name is `ads` some of its components might be blocked if you are using an adblocker.
